1. Find out how active are the users by calculating average steps and total distance on an average

SELECT
  Id,
  AVG(TotalSteps) AS Avg_steps,
  AVG(TotalDistance) AS Avg_Distance
FROM `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailyActivity_merged` 
GROUP By
Id

(This shows that on an average users steps were counted between 5k to 12k and their average distance covered is 5km to 10km's.)

2.What percentage of users reach goal of 10000?
verify number of users  reaching goal of 10000 steps

SELECT
  Id,
  AVG(StepTotal),
  CASE
    WHEN AVG(StepTotal) >= 10000 THEN 'Goal Reached'
    WHEN AVG(StepTotal) < 10000 THEN 'Goal Not Reached'
  END Meet10kGoal  
FROM `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailySteps_merged`
GROUP BY Id 

(The result shows that 80% of users are not reaching 10000 steps goal.)

3.Relationship between calories and total number of steps.

SELECT 
  cal.Id,cal.ActivityDay as Date,cal.Calories,step.StepTotal
FROM `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailyCalories_merged` AS cal
JOIN
  `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailySteps_merged` AS step
ON
  cal.Id = step.Id
  AND cal.ActivityDay = step.ActivityDay

(The more daily step means more calories burnt,which shows relation to active time spent.)

4.More active minutes spent and more active distance covered results in more calories burnt.

SELECT
  A.Id,A.ActivityDate,
  C.Calories,
 (I.VeryActiveMinutes + I.LightlyActiveMinutes + I.FairlyActiveMinutes) AS Total_active_minutes,
  (I.LightActiveDistance + I.ModeratelyActiveDistance + I.VeryActiveDistance) AS Total_active_distance
FROM `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailyActivity_merged` AS A
LEFT JOIN
  `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailyCalories_merged` AS C
ON
  A.Id = C.Id
  AND A.ActivityDate = C.ActivityDay
  AND A.Calories = C.Calories
INNER JOIN
  `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailyIntensities_merged` AS I
 
ON
  A.Id = I.Id
  AND A.LightlyActiveMinutes = I.LightlyActiveMinutes
  AND A.VeryActiveMinutes = I.VeryActiveMinutes
  AND A.FairlyActiveMinutes = I.FairlyActiveMinutes
  AND A.LightActiveDistance = I.LightActiveDistance
  AND A.VeryActiveDistance = I.VeryActiveDistance
  AND A.ModeratelyActiveDistance = I.ModeratelyActiveDistance

The active time spent and calories burnt,total steps,total distance covered are directly related in maintaining good weight and quality sleep.
SELECT
  A.Id 
  ,A.ActivityDate,
  A.Calories,
  A.TotalDistance,
  (A.LightlyActiveMinutes + A.VeryActiveMinutes + A.FairlyActiveMinutes) AS Total_active_minutes,
  A.TotalSteps,
  W.BMI

FROM `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.dailyActivity_merged` AS A
JOIN
  `sigma-crow-312622.fitbit_fitness_data.weightLogInfo_merged` AS W
ON
  A.Id = W.Id
  AND A.ActivityDate = CAST(W.Date AS DATE)
